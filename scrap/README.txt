Tools for scrapping traildamage.com

Run ScrapTrailDamage.py first to fill up the tddata directory with pickled 
files, where each file represents one trail (this program takes a bit 
because I wait a little time inbetween each call to traildamage.com). 
After data has been captured, run the ProcessScrapped.py script to get
the trail_damage.dat pickled data. That file contains every trail from
traildamage.com.
